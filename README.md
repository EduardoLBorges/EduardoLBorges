# Hi there! I'm Eduardo Borges 👋

### From Physics Equations to Robust Back-end Architectures

I am a **Physics Teacher** currently orchestrating a career pivot into **Software Engineering**, with a specialized focus on **Back-end Development**. If my years in the classroom have taught me anything, it's that complex systems—whether they are celestial bodies or microservices—rely on logic, stability, and well-defined rules.

## My Journey

For a long time, my world was defined by Newton's laws and thermodynamics. However, I discovered that my passion for solving abstract problems and "debugging" student misconceptions translates perfectly into the world of **Java** and **Python**. 

I am currently transitioning from explaining how the universe works to building the digital systems that keep our modern world running. My background in Physics gives me a unique perspective on **problem-solving, mathematical modeling, and structural thinking**, which I now apply to creating efficient and scalable server-side solutions.

## Technical Toolbox

While I am constantly expanding my horizons, here is what I am currently working with:

* **Languages:** My primary focus is **Java** (the "gravity" of my stack), complemented by **Python** for versatility and **SQL** for data integrity. I also have a solid grasp of **HTML/CSS** for when the front-end needs attention.
* **Frameworks & Tools:** Developing robust APIs using **Spring Boot** and **Flask**. I use **Docker** to ensure my environments are as predictable as a vacuum in a textbook problem.
* **Deep Dive:** I am currently immersed in deepening my knowledge of **Design Patterns, Clean Code, and Back-end Architectures**.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not deep in a stack trace or grading papers, you’ll likely find me:
* **Playing Chess:** A game of strategy where every move has a consequence—not unlike deploying to production.
* **Solving Puzzles:** I have an obsession with complex puzzles. If it’s challenging and requires 100% of my brainpower, I’m in.
* **Learning:** I believe that being a teacher makes me a better student. I am always looking for the "why" behind the syntax.

## Get in Touch

I am currently building my professional presence in the tech community. While my **LinkedIn** and **Portfolio** are under construction (much like a new theory), I am always open to discussing technology, back-end challenges, or a quick game of chess.

> "In physics, you try to explain something that nobody knew before in words that everyone can understand. In programming, it's often the opposite—but I'm here to bridge that gap."
